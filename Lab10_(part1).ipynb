    "# Visualizing and understanding ConvNets (part 1)\n",
    "In this Lab we will be experimenting with techniques for visualizing and understanding ConvNets. The lab is divided into three parts, but only the first two parts will be available at the first exercise class. You will get the third part next week, where you can also continue working on parts 1+2 in case you didn't finish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part (part 1) is about simple visualization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualizing layer activations**\n",
    " - Typically used to monitor training. As training progresses, the layer activations (i.e., feature maps) should become more local and sparse in nature.\n",
    "- **Visualizing filters**\n",
    " - Typically also used to monitor training. As training progresses, the filters should become nice and smooth. Noisy filters indicate that the network is not done training.\n",
    "- **Inspecting fully connected layers with K-NN**\n",
    " - The fully connected (FC) layers are where the magic happens in CNN classifiers. However, it is hard to visualize what these layers have learned. One common approach is run K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) using the learned feature representation. That is, for a given test image, compare with the nearest neighbours. Do they look similar? In what way are they similar?\n",
    "- **Visualization of FC layers using dimensionality reduction**\n",
    " - Another way to visualize what the FC layers have learned is by means of dimensionality reduction on the learned feature representation. Today, we will be looking at t-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of the lab is divided into to sub-parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In task 1 to 5 we will demonstrate how to apply the techniques mentioned above on a pre-trained CNN. Specifically, we will be looking at VGG16.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the final task, you will apply the techniques to monitor training of a custom CNN classifier on the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of part 1 will be a recap of [Lab 2](https://github.com/klaverhenrik/Deep-Learning-for-Visual-Recognition-2021/blob/main/Lab2_Solution.ipynb).\n",
